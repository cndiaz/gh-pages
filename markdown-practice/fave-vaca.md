# My Favorite Vacation

Summer 2019 in Japan was by far my favorite vacation. I spent 4 days in Kyoto and Osaka solo learning to navigate their public transport before moseying to Tokyo to join my classmates. I spent another week learning how several companies implement social media into their digital marketing strategy. A few tips:

1. Be mindful of noise level
2. Wear comfy shoes
3. Bring a small bag or pack to haul your trash
